## 🧩 OOP Principles in Action

This project demonstrates full mastery of Object-Oriented Programming:

| Principle       | Implementation Examples |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Inheritance** | Base `Game` class inherited by all three games |
| **Polymorphism** | Game updates/rendering handled via base pointers |
| **Encapsulation** | Clean separation between game logic, UI, and input |
| **Abstraction** | Common behavior abstracted in base classes |
| **Composition** | GameBoy composed of screen, input, menu, and game objects |
